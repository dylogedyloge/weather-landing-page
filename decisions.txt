Project Decisions and Assumptions

1. Project Structure:
   - Decision: Two separate projects - a landing page and a weather app.
   - Reasoning: This was a task requirement. It allows for separation of concerns and independent development/deployment of each component.

2. Technology Stack:
   - Landing Page: Pure JavaScript (TypeScript), Webpack
   - Weather App: React
   - Reasoning: The landing page using pure JavaScript was a task requirement. We chose TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience. React for the weather app allows for efficient UI updates and component-based architecture.

3. Weather API:
   - Decision: Use OpenWeatherMap API
   - Reasoning: This was specified in the task requirements. OpenWeatherMap provides reliable weather data and has a free tier suitable for this project.

4. Styling:
   - Decision: Use Tailwind CSS
   - Reasoning: Tailwind provides utility-first CSS, allowing for rapid UI development and consistent styling across both projects.

5. Build and Bundling:
   - Decision: Use Webpack for the landing page, Create React App for the weather app
   - Reasoning: Webpack provides powerful bundling capabilities for the custom JS/TS setup. Create React App offers a pre-configured environment for React development.

6. Weather App Integration:
   - Decision: Load the weather app in an iframe within the landing page
   - Reasoning: This allows for complete separation of the two apps while still enabling them to be displayed together. It also simplifies cross-origin issues.

7. Geolocation:
   - Decision: Use browser's Geolocation API with a fallback to IP-based geolocation
   - Reasoning: Browser geolocation provides accurate results when available. The fallback ensures functionality even if the user denies location access.

8. State Management:
   - Decision: Use React's built-in state management (useState, useEffect)
   - Reasoning: For a small-scale app, React's built-in state management is sufficient and reduces complexity.

9. Testing:
   - Decision: Implement unit tests and end-to-end tests
   - Reasoning: This was a task requirement. Unit tests ensure individual components work correctly, while e2e tests validate the overall user experience.

10. Deployment:
    - Decision: Use GitHub for version control and Firebase for hosting
    - Reasoning: GitHub provides robust version control and CI/CD capabilities. Firebase offers simple, fast hosting for web applications.

11. Automated Deployment:
    - Decision: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
    - Reasoning: This was a task requirement. GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly with our GitHub repositories and allows for automated building and deployment to Firebase.

12. Error Handling:
    - Decision: Implement error boundaries in React and try-catch blocks in critical areas
    - Reasoning: This improves app stability and provides a better user experience by gracefully handling potential errors.

13. Responsive Design:
    - Decision: Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS
    - Reasoning: Ensures the application is usable across various device sizes and types.

14. Code Quality:
    - Decision: Use ESLint and Prettier
    - Reasoning: Maintains consistent code style and helps catch potential errors early in development.

15. Performance Optimization:
    - Decision: Implement lazy loading for the weather app iframe
    - Reasoning: Improves initial load time of the landing page by deferring the loading of the weather app until it's needed.

These decisions were made to fulfill the project requirements while also considering best practices in web development, user experience, and maintainability.
