1. Structure of the Project:
   - Decision: Two distinct projects: a landing page and a weather application.
   - Reasoning: This was a task requirement. Separating the two projects ensures separation of concerns and allows each to be independently developed and deployed.

2. Technology Stack:
   - Landing Page: Pure JavaScript (TypeScript) in addition with Webpack
   - Weather Application: React;  Reasoning: Pure JavaScript to build the landing page was a task requirement. TypeScript provides better type safety and developer-friendly experience. React enables efficient UI updates and component-based application.

3. API for Weather:
   - Decision: Use OpenWeatherMap API
   - Reasoning: This was specified as part of the project requirements. OpenWeatherMap is a reliable source of weather information, and has a free version that works for this project.

4. Styling:
   - Decision: Using Tailwind CSS 
   - Reasoning: Tailwond CSS provides utility-first css, which allows a consistent styling, and speeds up UI development in each project.

5. Build / Bundling:
   - Decision: Use Webpack/tooling for the landing page & Create React App + Webpack for the weather application.
   - Reasoning: Webpack provides a powerful bundling experience for the custom JS/TS setup of the landing page. Create React App creates a frictionless experience for React and accommodates Webpack behind the scenes.

6. Weather Application Integration:
   - Decision: Embed the weather application in an iframe in the landing page.
   - Reasoning: This gives an ability to completely separate both applications, but gives the usability of viewing the web applications next too each other, overcoming some cross-origin issues.

7. Geolocation:
   - Decision: Use the browser's Geolocation API, serving accuracy when possible, and a fallback implementation based on the geolocation from the ip address itself.
   - Reasoning: Whenever the browser can use geolocation, this provides the most accurate result possible. This was also a task requirement. The fallback from the ip address makes our product usable even when the geolocation is denied by the user.

8. State Management:
   - Decision: Use reactâ€™s built-in state (ex: useState, useEffect).
   - Reasoning: In the scope of a small-scale application, using react's built-in state is sufficient state management for a small application.  React's built-in state also reduces complexity.

9. Testing;
   - Decision: Implement unit tests and end-to-end tests. 
   - Reasoning: This was part of the task requirement, and unit testing ensures that each component works consistently. End-to-end tests identify bugs during interactions. 

10. Deployment:
    - Decision: Use GitHub for version control and Firebase for hosting
    - Reasoning: GitHub provides robust version control and CI/CD capabilities. Firebase offers simple, fast hosting for web applications.

11. Automated Deployment:
    - Decision: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
    - Reasoning: This was a task requirement. GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly with our GitHub repositories and allows for automated building and deployment to Firebase.

12. Error Handling:
    - Decision: Implement error boundaries in React and try-catch blocks in critical areas
    - Reasoning: This improves app stability and provides a better user experience by gracefully handling potential errors.

13. Responsive Design:
    - Decision: Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS
    - Reasoning: Ensures the application is usable across various device sizes and types.

14. Code Quality:
    - Decision: Use ESLint and Prettier
    - Reasoning: Maintains consistent code style and helps catch potential errors early in development.

15. Performance Optimization:
    - Decision: Implement lazy loading for the weather app iframe
    - Reasoning: Improves initial load time of the landing page by deferring the loading of the weather app until it's needed.

These decisions were made to fulfill the project requirements while also considering best practices in web development, user experience, and maintainability.
